[h1]Framework Description[/h1]
This framework allows other modders to let their bionic parts or implants to change the max HP of body parts.

Note that when body part max HP is increased, the pain and bleeding rate will also increase.
[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*]This framework will throw errors if it detects any mod that tries to get the max HP of body parts without using this framework.
[*]This framework will continuously throw errors when Moody is also loaded. I am technically unable to fix this problem. Ask the guys developing Moody to have a look, and let them decide if they want to support this framework.

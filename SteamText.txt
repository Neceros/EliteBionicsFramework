[h1]Framework Description[/h1]
This framework allows other modders to let their bionic parts or implants to change the max HP of body parts.

Note that, normally, when body part max HP is increased, the pain and bleeding rate will both also increase. This mod scales down the bleeding rate in order to avoid nonsensical instant-death sithations due to instant-bleed-out.

However, pain levels are not touched to maintain balance. End users should aim for drugs, implants, or armor to reduce the pain of your soldiers/workers before and during battle.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*]This framework will throw errors if it detects any mod that tries to get the max HP of body parts without using this framework.
[*]This framework will continuously throw errors when Moody is also loaded. I am technically unable to fix this problem. Ask the guys developing Moody to have a look, and let them decide if they want to support this framework.
